# Zarektronix Assignment
For my project with [Zarektronix Technologies Pvt Ltd](https://www.zarektronix.com/), I successfully created a user registration application that seamlessly transitions between online and offline modes. It introduces the concept of "Schrodinger's Signup," where the registration form exists both online and offline. Meticulously implementing the design elements, I ensured a seamless and visually appealing user experience.
